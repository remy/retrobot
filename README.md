# 🤖 Retrobot

A retrospective bot for Slack (inspired by [@PebbleKat's retrobot](https://github.com/PebbleKat/retrobot) 💙).

The bot will record retrospective feedback (via DMs) and then display in a group channel in a random order, allowing everyone to vote on "needs work" with a 👍, after which a summary of the top 3 can be reported. All inside of Slack.

## Prerequisites

Before creating the retrobot, you need to [create a new Slack bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) and record your API token. I'd recommend using one of the [🤖 emojis](http://emojipedia.org/robot-face), or you can, if you like, also use the [retrobot](https://github.com/remy/retrobot/blob/master/icon.png) image as your avatar for your bot.

## The quick way

You can use the Heroku button below, and add the API token for the bot you created earlier:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/remy/retrobot)

## Manual install and deploy

Using node 6, you can manually run the retrobot using the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/remy/retrobot.git
$ cd retrobot
$ npm install
$ SLACK_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXX npm start
```

The bot should then join your Slack group.

## How to

In your retrospective channel (call it what you will), invite the retrobot and start the session:

```text
> /invite @retrobot
> @retrobot: start
< 🔔 Retrospective is now recording
```

Each participant in the channel the retrospective was start in, will receive a DM asking them for their retrospective feedback.

Items that "worked well" are prefixed with a `+`. Items that "need work" are prefixed with a `-`. For example, in a private DM session with the retrobot:

```text
> + regular cake Friday
> - morning laps around the office when we arrive late
```

Items that don't start with the `+/-` prefix will be echoed back as ignored.

Once the retro is over, in the group channel stop the retrospective:

```text
> @retrobot: stop
```

The retrobot will then print out a shuffled list of all the worked well, and needs work items. Each item can be voted on using then 👍 emoji, and the group can use this to decide how to create action items out of the retrospective.

If you want a quick summary of the "needs work" items with the most 👍 counts, run:

```text
> @retrobot: summary
```

The retrobot will echo out the top 3 most 👍'd items from the "needs work" list.

### Auto ending the retrospective

You can set an auto-end for the retrospective using an argument to the `start` command. The supported shorthand is a number, then `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes. For example, the following will auto end the retrospective after 10 minutes:

```text
> @retrobot start 10m
< 🔔 Retrospective is now recording, and will auto end in 10m
```

### Custom responses

If you want a little fun with the retrobot, you can set some simple responses to specific queries. The retrobot will read the environment for keys starting with `SAY_` and use the use the value as an alias.

For example, if there is an environment value of `SAY_HEY='Hey there yourself :wave:'`, then the retrobot can respond as such:

```text
> @retrobot hey
< Hey there yourself 👋
```

Everything after `SAY_` is set to lowercase and only the first word relpied to the retrobot is used in the lookup.

If you're using Heroku CLI, then to add a new value, use the following:

```text
$ heroku config:set SAY_HEY='Hey there yourself :wave:'
```

## Notes

- Retrobot will not invite users who are away or have an active do not disturb mode enabled
